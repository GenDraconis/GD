# Mission
To provide an interactive bot for all Digimon fans.

# Example-RPG

# Example-Trivia

# Example-PvP

# Requirements for help developing the bot
We currently use several libraries to interace the bot through Discord.

The main interface library is provided by Sleepy Discord (https://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord/)
I'm using the following web-releated libraries to make the interfacing possible:
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
* [cpr](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr)
* [Websocket++](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp)

# C++ standard
Core and Standard library up to C++17 is used. Some tweaking of the aforementioned libraries must be done.
